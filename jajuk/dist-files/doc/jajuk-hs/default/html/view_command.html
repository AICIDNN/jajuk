<h1>The command view</h1>
<p>The command view is located at the top of Jajuk window. It is a static
view that is always visible in all perspectives. It is used to control
the player and perform searches.</p>

<h2>Menu</h2>
<p>File</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; File -&gt; Open File (Alt-f): Allows to open one or more tracks 
(we call them basic tracks because they may not be indexed in collection). You can choose
any music files on your disks, not only those from your devices. Note
however that this function is not recommended because basic tracks will
show less information and will not be enqueued in the history bar. When
opened, the tracks are played immediately, not pushed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; File -&gt; Exit (Alt-x): Quit Jajuk. Note you can also exit Jajuk
by simply closing the Window or using the tray.</p>
<p>Views -&gt; Restaure defaults: Reorganize views as shipped by authors.</p>
<p>Properties -&gt; Not yet implemented, will be used to create and manage custom properties</p>
<p>Mode -&gt; Controls for modes ( repeat, shuffle, continue, intro). Same as two-states buttons
bellow.</p>
<p>Help</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Help -&gt; Contents: show Help view.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Help -&gt; About: show About view with authors and system information.</p>

<p>The history bar shows all tracks you

one track to launch it again. Note that tracks in the history bar may
be on devices that are no more mounted. In this case, Jajuk will ask
you to mount them if available.</p>
