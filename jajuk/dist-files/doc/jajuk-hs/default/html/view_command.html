<h1>The command view</h1>
<p>The command view is located at the top of Jajuk window. It is a static
view that is always visible in all perspectives. It is used to control
the player and perform searches.</p>

<h2>Menu</h2>
<p>File</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; File -&gt; Open File (Alt-f): Allows opening one or more tracks 
(we call them basic tracks because they may not be indexed in collection). You can choose
any music files from your disks, not only those from your devices. Note
however that this function is not recommended because basic tracks will
show less information and will not be added in the history bar. When
opened, the tracks are played immediately, not pushed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; File -&gt; Exit (Alt-x): Quit Jajuk. Note you can also exit Jajuk
by simply closing the Window or using the tray.</p>
<p>Views -&gt; Restore defaults: Reorganize views as shipped by authors.</p>
<p>Properties -&gt; Not yet implemented, will be used to create and manage custom properties</p>
<p>Mode -&gt; Controls for modes ( repeat, shuffle, continue, intro). Same as two-states buttons
bellow.</p>
<p>Help</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Help -&gt; Contents: show Help view.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Help -&gt; About: show <a href='view_about.html'>the About view</a> with credentials and system information.</p>
<h2>Search box and history bar<br>

<i>Fig.
02: Selecting a track with command view</i><br>
<p><b>Using search box(1):</b><br>
<p>The search box can be used to find any file, track,
style, author, album... for a given text. A result popup appears.
Then launch the track by clicking on the list: the track will be
played immediately.</p>
<p><b>Using history bar(2):</b>
<p>The history bar shows all tracks you
played (can be cleared and configured in the Parameter view). Click
on one track to launch it again. Note that tracks in the history bar may
be on devices that are no more mounted. In this case, Jajuk will ask
you to mount them if available.</p>
<h2>Modes</h2>
<p>Modes set the player behavior when selected before and during the play.
All combinations of modes are allowed. Note that you can see which
tracks are repeated thanks special icons in the playlist editor view.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../icons/16x16/repeat.png"
 style="width: 16px; height: 16px;"> Repeat mode [default=off]):
When checked, next launched selection will be played in a loop. If it
is checked during a play, only current track will repeat.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../icons/16x16/shuffle.png"
 style="width: 16px; height: 16px;"> Shuffle mode [default=off]:
When checked, next launched selection will
be played randomly. If it is checked during a play, current selection
will randomize.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../icons/16x16/continue.png"
 style="width: 16px; height: 16px;"> Continue mode [default=on]: When checked, player will not stop when
selection is played but will continue to play next albums or tracks.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../icons/16x16/intro.png"
 style="width: 16px; height: 16px;"> Intro mode [default=off]:
When checked, only a part of each track will be played
(begin position and play time can bet set in the Parameter
view/Options tab)</p>
<h2>Special functions</h2>
