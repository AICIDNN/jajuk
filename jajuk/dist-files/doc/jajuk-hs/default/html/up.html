<H1>Using playlists</H1>
<P>A playlist is a set of preselected tracks. Jajuk uses m3u format
to read and write playlist files. Note that files in playlists can be
located outside any Jajuk device. In this case, Jajuk can read them
but some limitations apply to them. For instance, they are not added
in the history bar.</P>
<H2>Playlist types</H2>
<P><IMG SRC="../images/up01_1.jpg" NAME="Image1" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=486 BORDER=0><BR><I>Fig
01: different types of playlists</I> 
</P>
<P>1- Queue Playlist: display tracks to be played</P>
<P>2- New Playlist: void at startup, use it to create new playlists.

<P>3- Bookmarks playlist: drag and drop tracks into this playlist to

<H2>Playing/saving a playlist</H2>
<P>To launch a playlist, you can: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Select a playlist by left clicking
	on it. Then, you can launch any playlist by clicking on it. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Right-click on a playlist and click on &quot;play&quot; menu
	option. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>To save a playlist:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Right-click on a playlist and select 'save' or 'save as' in
	the popup menu. 
	</P>
</UL>
<H2>Regular playlists</H2>
<P>When refreshing a device, Jajuk will find all m3u files that will
be displayed in the playlist repository view. Note that if you are in
physical perspective, a same playlist file duplicated in different
devices will be displayed several times. In Logical perspective, you
will not see playlists files but logical playlists. So, only one
logical playlist will be displayed and will map several physical
playlists files. If you modify one logical playlist, modification
will be propagated to every mapped physical playlist files (a warning
message will be displayed).</P>
<H2>Using playlist editor</H2>
<P>The playlist editor allows you changing tracks order, adding new
tracks or removing somes.</P>
