<h1>Using playlists</h1>
<p>A playlist is a set of preselected tracks. Jajuk uses m3u format to
read and write playlist files. Note that files in playlists can be
located outside any Jajuk device. In this case, Jajuk can read them but
some limitations apply to them. For instance, they are not added in the
history bar.</p>
<h2>Playlist types</h2>

<i>Fig 01 : different types of playlists</i>
<p>1- Queue Playlist: display tracks to be played</p>
<p>2- New Playlist : void at startup, use it to create new playlists. Drag
&amp; drop inside from tree or table views to add tracks.</p>
<p>3- Bookmarks playlist : drag and drop track inside to quickly access
your favorite tracks.</p>
<p>4- Best of playlist : contains the 20 best tracks of your collection.</p>
<p>5 - Some regular playlist ( .m3u files ).</p>
<h2>Playing/saving a playlist</h2>
<p>To launch a playlist, you can: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Select a playlist by left-clicking on it. Then, you can launch
any playlist by clicking on it.</li>
  <li>Right-click on a playlist and click on "play" menu option.</li>
</ul>
<p>To save a playlist:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Right-click on a playlist and select 'save' or 'save as' in the
popup menu.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Regular playlists</h2>
<p>When refreshing a device, Jajuk will find all m3u files which will be
displayed in the playlist repository view. Note that if you are in
physical perspective, sames playlist files on different devices will be
displayed several times. In Logical perspective, you will not see
playlists files but logical playlists. So, only once logical playlist
will be displayed and will map several physical playlists files. If you
modify one logical playlist, modification will be propagate to every
mapped physical playlist files ( a warning message will be displayed ).</p>
<h2>Using playlist editor</h2>
<p>The playlist editor allows you to change tracks order, to add new
tracks or remove ones.</p>
