<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The style repartition (it is
	reliable only if your collection is well tagged). It allows you
	knowing which style you own the most. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The size repartition by devices.
	It allows you knowing what are your device sizes in comparison. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Your entire collection size per
	mouth (a same track can map several files). It is used to get a
	collection size evolution: can be useful to know if some cleanups
	are required for example. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Your entire collection number of tracks per month. It allows
	you knowing how many actual different tracks you have, independently
	of the number of redundant files you have in your collection.
