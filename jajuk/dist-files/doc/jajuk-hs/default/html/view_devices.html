<h1>The Devices view</h1>




<p>This view displays devices you created and manages them.
Please
read the <a href="devices.html">Using Devices page</a>
to learn about
devices principles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Note you&nbsp;can also create Folder devices using the quick start
devices wizard&nbsp; (top menu -&gt; help -&gt; Device wizard).&nbsp;</p>




<h2>The devices repository</h2>




<p>In the lower part of the Devices view, you will find devices
you
created. The green arrow on the bottom of a device means it is now
mounted.</p>

&nbsp;This is not an actual device but a shortcut to create a new
one. Please click on it to create a new Device.</p>

(please

<h2>Device configuration wizard</h2>




<p>If you don't understand Jajuk device notions like mounting,
refreshing or synchronizing, please read the <a href="devices.html">Using
Devices page</a>.</p>




<p>This window appears when you create a new device or when you
update some properties of an existing device. You can show device
properties by double clicking on it, by using contextual menu/ Get
Properties or by selecting the device and using the Properties button
in the Control Pane. It features:</p>




<ul>




  <li>
    
    
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Device type combo box
(Cannot be changed after creation): choose the device type you wish to
create. </p>




  </li>




  <li>
    
    
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Device name (Cannot be
changed after creation): Enter name of the device. For example "CD A"
for a CD or "Laptop" for a directory. </p>




  </li>




  <li>
    
    
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Device location (Cannot
be changed after creation): full path to the device. For example
"/data/music" under Unix or "d:\music" under Windows. You can use the
directory selector using the button on the right. </p>




  </li>




  <li>
    
    
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Unix mount point (only
under Linux/Unix). This is optional and allows Jajuk trying to perform
a system "mount" command if required when mounting a device. For
example, if you want to mount a CD device whose Unix mount point is
/mnt/cdrom and that CD is not Unix mounted, Jajuk will try to mount it
by itself. Note however that this should be useless with last Linux
distributions that perform auto-mount. </p>




  </li>




  <li>
    
    
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">"Perform an instant
refresh" (default = true): Perform a device refresh immediately after
creating the device. This is recommended. Note that this should take a
while, especially for the first time. </p>




  </li>




  <li>
    
    
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">"Auto mount at startup"
(checked by default for some types): Perform an auto-mount when
starting Jajuk. This is recommended for directories or eventually
external devices if always plugged but avoid this for CD or devices
that can be unplugged or changed quite often. </p>




  </li>




  <li>
    
    
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">"Auto refresh at
startup (default = false)": refresh device at each Jajuk startup (not
recommended, especially for large devices).</p>




  </li>




  <li>
    
    
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Synchronized with combo
box: If you have more than one device, you will be able to synchronize
them. The current device is the target device and the other one the
source device. </p>




    
    
    
    <ul>




      <li>
        
        
        
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">"Unidirectional
synchronization": all new files from the source device are copied to
this device. </p>




      </li>




      <li>
        
        
        
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">"Bidirectional
synchronization": all new files from one device are copied to the
other. </p>




      </li>




    
    
    
    </ul>




    
    
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><u>Notes:</u>
    </p>




    
    
    
    <ul>




      <li>
        
        
        
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">You can ignore
recursively some directories when performing synchronization (if the
two synchronized devices have not the same capacity for example) by
desynchronizing directories in the Physical tree/ contextual menu on
directories. </p>




      </li>




      <li>
        
        
        
        <p>Synchronization never performs deletes so if you
renames some files on the source device, you will get both older and
newer version in the target device after synchronization. </p>




      </li>




    
    
    
    </ul>
