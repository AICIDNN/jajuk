<h1>The CD Scanner view</h1>
<p>This view allows to build CD Device in seconds. It is only used to create a Jajuk device based on a DATA CD, we mean a CD with audio files, not Audio CDs!
If you are not familiar with the Jajuk Device notion, please read "Using Devices" page. You can create a CD device using the device view, selecting "CD" etc... but 
if you want to create a 50 MP3 CD Jajuk collection for exemple, it is *much* faster to use the CD Scanner that scan the CD and build the device  by simply giving :
<ul>
	<li>CD name: ROCK 1 for instance</li>
	<li>CD location (is saved for next scan): F/ under Windows, /mnt/cdrom under Gnu/Linux for example</li>
</ul>
and lauching the scan by clicking on the "Scan" button.
