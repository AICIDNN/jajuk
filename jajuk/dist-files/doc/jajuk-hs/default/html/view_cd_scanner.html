<h1>The CD Scanner view</h1>
<p>This view allows building CD Device in seconds. It is only used to create a Jajuk device based on a DATA CD, we mean a CD with audio files, not Audio CDs!
If you are not familiar with the Jajuk Device notion, please read <a href='devices.html'>Using Devices</a>  page. You can create a CD device using the device view, 
But if you want to create a 50 MP3 CD Jajuk collection, it is *much* faster to use the CD Scanner that scans the CD and build the device  by simply providing:
<ul>
	<li>CD name: "ROCK 1" for instance</li>
	<li>CD location (is saved for next scan): "F:" under Windows, "/mnt/cdrom" under Gnu/Linux for example</li>
</ul>
Then launch the scan by clicking on the "Scan" button.
