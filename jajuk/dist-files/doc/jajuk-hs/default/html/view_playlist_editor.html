<H1>The Playlist Editor view</H1>
<P>This view can be used to watch queue states or to change tracks
order, to add new tracks or remove others. It works on the playlist
selected in the <A HREF="view_playlist_repository.html">Playlist
Repository view</A>.</P>
<H2>Different types of items</H2>
<P>In the playlist editor, you will find several types of items:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="../../fr/icons/16x16/playlist.png" NAME="Image2" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=16 BORDER=0>
&nbsp; <SPAN LANG="fr-FR">Regular tracks in the playlist.</SPAN></P>
<P><IMG SRC="../icons/16x16/player_perspective.png" NAME="Image1" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=16 BORDER=0>
&nbsp;In the Queue playlist only: user selection to be played.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="../icons/16x16/clock.png" NAME="Image1" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=16 BORDER=0>
&nbsp;Planned tracks (only in Queue playlist): shows next tracks to
be played when selection is done and if you use the continue mode
(see <A HREF="pm.html">Playing music page</A>). It is useful to know
which are next tracks when there are no more than one or few files in
the queue.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="../icons/16x16/repeat.png" NAME="Image1" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=16 BORDER=0>
&nbsp;Repeated tracks (only in Queue playlist): shows tracks that are
played in a loop. Note that you can have a regular selection after a
repeated one but never the opposite.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../icons/16x16/remove.png" NAME="Image1" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=16 BORDER=0>
&nbsp;Remove a file from this playlist. Next tracks go up in the
list.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="../icons/16x16/add_shuffle.png" NAME="Image1" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=16 BORDER=0>
&nbsp;Add a shuffle track. Same behavior than the regular adds.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="../icons/16x16/up.png" NAME="Image1" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=16 BORDER=0>

<P><IMG SRC="../icons/16x16/down.png" NAME="Image1" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=16 BORDER=0>

<P><IMG SRC="../icons/16x16/clear.png" NAME="Image1" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=16 BORDER=0>

<P>Note that you can also add new files in the playlist by drag and
drop from tree or table views.
