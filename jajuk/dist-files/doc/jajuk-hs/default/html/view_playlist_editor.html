<h1>The Playlist Editor view</h1>

<p><span lang="en-US">This view can be used to watch
queue states or
to change tracks order, to add new tracks or remove others. It works
on the playlist selected in the </span><a href="../html/view_playlist_repository.html"><span lang="en-US">Playlist
Repository view</span></a><span lang="en-US">.</span></p>

&nbsp;<span lang="en-US">Planned tracks (only in Queue
playlist):
shows next tracks to be played when selection is done and if you use
the continue mode (see </span><a href="../html/pm.html"><span lang="en-US">Playing
