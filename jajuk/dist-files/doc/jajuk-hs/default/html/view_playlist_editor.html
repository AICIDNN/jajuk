<h1>The Playlist Editor view</h1>
<p>This view can be used to watch queue states or to change tracks order, to add new tracks or remove others. It works on the playlist selected in the <a href='view_playlist_repository.html'>Playlist Repository view</a>.</p>

<h2>Different types of items</h2>
<p>In the playlist editor, you will find several types of items:</p>
<p><IMG SRC="../icons/16x16/player_perspective.png" NAME="Image1" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=16 BORDER=0>
	&nbsp;Regular tracks in the playlist. In the Queue playlist, it matches user selection to be played.</p>
<p><IMG SRC="../icons/16x16/clock.png" NAME="Image1" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=16 BORDER=0>
	&nbsp;Planned tracks (only in Queue playlist): shows next tracks to be played when selection is done and if you use the continue mode (see <a href='pm.html'>Playing music page</a>). It is useful to know 
	which are next tracks when there are no more than one or few files in the queue.</p>
<p><IMG SRC="../icons/16x16/repeat.png" NAME="Image1" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=16 BORDER=0>
	&nbsp;Repeated tracks (only in Queue playlist): shows tracks that are played in a loop. Note that you can have a regular selection after a repeated 
	one but never the opposite.</p>

<h2>The Control Panel</h2>
<p><IMG SRC="../icons/16x16/player_play.png" NAME="Image1" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=16 BORDER=0>
	&nbsp;Play selected playlist (all playlists except Queue)</p>
<p><IMG SRC="../icons/16x16/save.png" NAME="Image1" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=16 BORDER=0>
	&nbsp;Save the playlist (all playlists). If it is a special playlist, Jajuk will ask you to provide a path and filename to store the playlist.</p>
<p><IMG SRC="../icons/16x16/add.png" NAME="Image1" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=16 BORDER=0>
	&nbsp;Add a new file to this playlist. When none line is selected, it adds a new item at the end of the playlist. Otherwise, it adds the track at the current selected line (previous item goes after it).
In the Queue playlist, it is not possible to change current track so it is not possible to perform an add on the first line.</p>
<p><IMG SRC="../icons/16x16/remove.png" NAME="Image1" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=16 BORDER=0>
	&nbsp;Remove a file from this playlist. Next tracks go up in the list.</p>
<p><IMG SRC="../icons/16x16/add_shuffle.png" NAME="Image1" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=16 BORDER=0>
	&nbsp;Add a shuffle track. Same behavior than the regular adds.</p>
<p><IMG SRC="../icons/16x16/up.png" NAME="Image1" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=16 BORDER=0>
	&nbsp;Up: decrease file playing index</p>
<p><IMG SRC="../icons/16x16/down.png" NAME="Image1" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=16 BORDER=0>
	&nbsp;Down: increase file playing index</p>
<p><IMG SRC="../icons/16x16/clear.png" NAME="Image1" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=16 BORDER=0>
&nbsp;Clear playlist. Under Queue playlist, it means to stop the player and void the queue.</p>
