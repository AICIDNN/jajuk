<h1>The Cover view</h1>
<p>This view displays local (files on your disk) or remote (from the Net) covers. It can be configurated in the Parameter view / Cover and Network tabs. This view can be found in Physical, Logical and Player perspectives.</p>
<p><u>Notes:</u> </p>
<ul>
  <li>Maximum covers size is 500MB to avoid some memory issues. All local or remote covers over this size are just ignored.</li>
  <li>When looking for local covers, Jajuk takes all supported (see Supported formats page) image files found in the current directory but also 
	in all directories of the track. For instance, if you play a track from your harddisk and this file is also on a mounted CD with different covers, Jajuk will display all of them.
  It is useful because this way, you can save covers (see later) without having to mind on which device you saved them.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Control panel</h2>
<p><img alt="" src="../icons/16x16/previous.png" style="width: 16px; height: 16px;">&nbsp;Display previous cover</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../icons/16x16/next.png" style="width: 16px; height: 16px;">&nbsp;Display next cover</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../icons/16x16/delete.png" style="width: 16px; height: 16px;">&nbsp;Delete physicalty the cover from your disk. By default, you will have a confirmation 
	(can be set in the Parameter view/Confirmations tab))</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../icons/16x16/save.png" style="width: 16px; height: 16px;">&nbsp;Save current cover (only remote covers) on your disk (current track directory) using its original name</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../icons/16x16/saveas.png" style="width: 16px; height: 16px;">&nbsp;Save current cover (only remote covers) on your disk using path and name of your choice</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../icons/16x16/ok.png" style="width: 16px; height: 16px;">&nbsp;Make current cover the default cover so it will displayed first if you don't use the Cover shuffle option (is the default).
	If the cover is a remote cover not already on the disk, it will be downloaded and saved first. </p>
<p>o Size(L or @): Gives size in KB of this image. A 'L' means it is a local image and a '@' means it is a remote image.</p>
<p>o x/y: Gives current index over total number of covers available.</p>
<p>o Search type (Low accuracy, Medium accuracy, High accuracy, Author, Album and Track): Set accuracy for remote covers (used only if you use the Auto-cover feature, this is the default).
	Low, medium and high accuracy performs search on both the author and the album names. The difference is than the more the accuracy will be high, the less you will get covers
 but the more the chance of getting a right cover is high. Author, album and track only perform searchs respectively on the author, the album and  the track name. </p>
<h2>Cover view options</h2>
<p>You can benefit from advanced cover option (see <a href="view_parameter.html">Parameter view page</a> for more details). You can tell Jajuk to: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Adapt or not adapt covers to the view size</li>
	<li>Shuffle covers</li>
	<li>Refresh cover at each track (if shuffled) </li>
	<li>Pre-load all remote covers to accelerate navigation</li>
	<li>Set minimum and maximum for remote covers</li>
</ul>
<p>Note you can also tune network options like proxy and connection time out if you experience problems getting remote covers (see Parameter view / Network tab). 
<h2>Cover views in the player perspective</h2>
 <p>In the Player perspective, you will find two cover views. By default, one is configurated to display author-related covers and the other one Album-related covers. 
 It should be the best way to display covers when playing. If you like this feature, we advice you to set the "shuffle covers" and "Load cover at each track" options.</p>
