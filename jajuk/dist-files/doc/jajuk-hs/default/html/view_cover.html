<H1>The Cover view</H1>
<P>This view displays local (files on your disk) or remote (from the
Web) covers. It can be configured in the Parameter view / Cover and
Network tabs. This view can be found in Physical, Logical and Player
perspectives.</P>
<P><U>Notes:</U>

<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Maximum covers size is 1Mb to
	avoid memory issues. All local or remote covers over this size
	are just ignored. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>When looking for local covers, Jajuk takes all supported (see
	Supported formats page) image files found in the current directory
	but also in all directories of the track. For instance, if you play
	a track from your hard disk and this file is also on a mounted CD
	with different covers, Jajuk will display all of them. It is useful
	because this way, you can save covers (see later) without having to
	mind on which device you saved them.

original name</P>
<P><IMG SRC="../icons/16x16/saveas.png" NAME="Image5" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=16 BORDER=0>&nbsp;Save
a current remote cover on your disk using path and name of your
choice</P>
<P><IMG SRC="../icons/16x16/ok.png" NAME="Image6" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=16 BORDER=0>&nbsp;Make
current cover the default cover so it will be displayed the first if
you don't use the Cover shuffle option (is the default). If the cover
is a remote cover not already on the disk, it will be downloaded and
saved first. 
</P>
<P>o Size(L or @): Gives size in KB of this image. A 'L' means it 's
a local image and a '@' means it's a remote image.</P>
<P>o x/y: Gives current index over total number of covers available.</P>
<P>o Search type (Low accuracy, Medium accuracy, High accuracy,
Artist, Album and Title): Set accuracy for remote covers (used only
if you use the Auto-cover feature, this is the default). Low, medium
and high accuracy performs search on both the artist and the album
names. The difference is than the more the accuracy will be high, the
less you will get covers but the more the chance of getting a right
cover is high. Artists, Album and Title only perform searches
respectively on the artist, the album and the track title. 
</P>
<H2>Cover view options</H2>
<P>You can benefit from advanced cover option (see <A HREF="view_parameter.html">Parameter
view page</A> for more details). You can tell Jajuk to:

	</P>
</UL>
<P>Note you can also tune network options like proxy and connection
time out if you experience problems getting remote covers (see
Parameter view / Network tab). 
</P>
<H2>Cover views in the player perspective</H2>
<P>In the Player perspective, you will find two cover views. By
default, one is configured to display artist-related covers and the
other one album-related covers. It should be the best way to display
covers when playing. If you like this feature, we advice you to set
the &quot;shuffle covers&quot; and &quot;Load cover at each track&quot;
options.</P>
