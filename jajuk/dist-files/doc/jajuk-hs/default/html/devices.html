<h1>Using Devices</h1>





<h2>Definition</h2>





<p>Jajuk plays music from devices. A device is a set of audio
files.
It can be : </p>





<ul>





  <li>
    
    
    
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">A directory </p>





  </li>





  <li>
    
    
    
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">A data CD-ROM </p>





  </li>





  <li>
    
    
    
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">An External Hard Disk </p>





  </li>





  <li>
    
    
    
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">A Network drive
(Netbios/Samba/NFS...). Under Windows, use drive letter path (like
T:\...) and not network favorites path or UNC paths.</p>





  </li>





  <li>
    
    
    
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">A&nbsp;MP3 player. </p>





  </li>





  <li>
    
    
    
    
    <p>A Remote directory (not yet implemented) </p>





  </li>





</ul>





<p><u>Note</u>: In all cases except remote, devices
are regular
directories from the OS point of view but Jajuk makes the difference
to deal with particularities (for instance, a CD-ROM is read-only)
and to provide a friendlier graphical interface.</p>





<p>A device usually contains MP3, OGG and others supported audio
files, M3P files for playlists and JPG, GIF and others supported
image files for covers.</p>





<p>What we name a collection is the combination of devices you
created.</p>



<h2>Creating and configurating devices</h2>



<p>Devices can be created either using&nbsp;<a href="view_devices.html">the
Device view</a> in the Configuration perspective or using the quick start devices wizard (Top menu -&gt; help -&gt; Devices wizard).</p>
<h2>Refreshing devices</h2>





<p>Jajuk uses an automatic indexing system: music
files are not scanned and their tags not read again at each startup but
Jajuk builds a collection at refreshing (stored on the disk
as {home directory}/.jajuk/collection.xml). It allows Jajuk to start
and be aware of all tracks from a multi 100GB+ of music collection in
only few seconds. It is also used to perform searches and filtering
on the entire collection in real time.</p>





<p>Jajuk only knows files from refreshed devices: if you copy a
file
on your disk, Jajuk will be aware of it&nbsp;only after the next device
refresh. Device refreshing is automatic and scanning frequency can be set in&nbsp; <a href="view_devices.html">the
Device view</a>.
Default frequency for hard disk devices (directory devices) are 30 sec
(0.5 mins) and scanning often takes less than few secs so if you remove
or add some files in this device, the change will be reflected into the
application after about 30 seconds. Note that frequency used for
network drives are much longer (default: 5 mins) because scanning them
takes a longer time (1 min or more for huge drives) and
consumes&nbsp;network bandwidth.</p>










<p>Jajuk doesn't read tags for known files. You can force it to read
them with the "Force refresh" function in Physical tree view on devices nodes or from <a href="view_devices.html">the
Device view</a>&nbsp;if you changed tags using another application.</p>
<h2>Mounting/unmouting devices</h2>





<p>Mounting a device means to make it available and unmounting it
means to disconnect it. You can
configure devices in the Device view so they will be automatically
mounted at startup. Some device can naturally be auto-mounted: a
directory from your internal hard disk for example. On the other
hand, we highly discourage to auto-mount some others like CD or USB
keys because they are likely to be unavailable at next startup. When
a mount is required on a device, Jajuk will check it is physically
available (for a CD for instance) and try to access it if required.
Note that under Unix, it can eventually perform a "mount" command. If
you try to play a track located in an unmounted device, Jajuk will
ask you if you want it to mount this device. In all cases, you will
get an error message if the device cannot be mounted.</p>





<p>You can mount or unmount a device from the physical
perspective
with "Mount or Unmount" commands from contextual menu on
selected device or from <a href="view_devices.html">the
Device view</a> in the Configuration perspective.</p>





<h2>Synchronizing devices</h2>





<p>When creating a device (see device view documentation for more
information), you can tell Jajuk to make it synchronized with another
device. This allows you to copy by a single click all the new files
from source device to the other. Note that you can perform partial
synchronization by desynchronizing some directories in the Physical
perspective / Physical tree with&nbsp;contextual menu on directories (watch
the selection box in the Information view at the bottom to know
recursive size of a selection). You can also perform bidirectional
synchronizations (all new files from a device are copied to the
other) and not only unidirectional.</p>





<p>You can synchronize two devices from the physical perspective
with
"Synchronize" command from contextual menu on selected
device or from <a href="view_devices.html">the
Device view</a> in the Configuration perspective.<br>
</p>
<h2><a name="backup"></a>Collection backup and
restore</h2>





<p>All your collection and properties on your tracks are stored
in
the collection file (<span style="font-family: monospace;">{home directory}/.jajuk/collection.xml</span> file). By
default Jajuk performs a backup of this collection file
(<span style="font-family: monospace;">collection-&lt;date&gt;.xml</span> files) until it takes 20MB on the
disk.
You can parameter backup in the Parameter view / Advanced tab.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Restore: if you just made a manipulation error and still in
jajuk,
close the it and overwrite <span style="font-family: monospace;">collection_exit.xml</span> file with
<span style="font-family: monospace;">collection.xml</span>. If you want to overwrite with an older release,
overwrite <span style="font-family: monospace;">collection_exit.xml
</span>with&nbsp;<span style="font-family: monospace;">collection-{date}.xml</span>
file. Then restart jajuk.</p>





<p>It can be a good idea to include your&nbsp;<span style="font-family: monospace;">{home
directory}/.jajuk</span>
directory in a periodic backup.</p>
