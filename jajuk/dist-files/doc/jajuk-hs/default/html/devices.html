<h1>Using Devices<br>
</h1>
<h2>Definition</h2>
Jajuk plays music from devices. A device is a set of files. It can be :<br>
<ul>
  <li>A directory</li>
  <li>A data CD-ROM</li>
  <li>A Remote directory (not yet implemented)<br>
  </li>
  <li>An External Hard Disk<br>
  </li>
  <li>A Physical Player like an iPod</li>
</ul>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Note</span> : In all cases
except Remote, devices are regular directories from the OS point of
view but Jajuk makes the difference to deal with particularities (for
instance, a CD-ROM is read-only) and to provide a more fiendly
Graphical Interface.<br>
Devices usually contains MP3, OGG and others supported audio files, M3P
files for playlists and JPG, GIF and others supported image files for
covers.<br>
<br>
What we name a collection is the set of devices you created.<br>
<br>
<h2>Refreshing devices</h2>
Under Jajuk, devices should be refreshed from times to times. Indeed,
what's make Jajuk so fast is its collection index: music files are not
scanned nor there tags read at each startup but Jajuk builds during
refresh a collection or index (stores on the disk as {home
directory}/.jajuk/collection.xml). It allows Jajuk to start and be
aware of all files from a multi 100GB of music collection in only few
seconds. It also allow to perform searchs and filtering on the entire
collection in real time.<br>
Jajuk only know files from refreshed devices : if you copy a file on
your disk, Jajuk will know it only after the associated device refresh.
<br>
Devices can be refreshed at each startup but it is not recommented
because of the delay. Note however that Jajuk integrates some
optimizations that greatly accelerates refreshing: by default, Jajuk
doesn't read tags for known files. You can force it to read them with
the "Force tag read" option in Parameter View / Option tab if you
changed tags using another application.<br>
You can refresh a device from the physical perspective with "Refresh"
command from contextual menu on selected device or from the Device view
in the Configuration perspective.<br>
<br>
<h2>Synchronizing devices</h2>
When creating a device (see device view documentation for more
information), you can&nbsp; tell Jajuk to make it synchronized with
another device. This allows you to copy by a single click all the new
files from source device to the other. Note that you can perform
partial synchronization by desynchronizing some directories in the
Physical perspective / Physical tree and contextual menu on
directories. You can also perform bidirectional synchronizations (all
new files from a device are copied to the other) and not only
unidirectional. <br>
You can launch a synchronization from the Physical Tree in Physical
perspective / contextual menu on a device or from the Device view in
Configuration perspective.<br>
<br>
<h2>Collection backup</h2>
All your collection and properties on your tracks are stored in the
collection file ({home directory}/.jajuk/collection.xml file). By
default Jajuk performs a backup of this collection file
(collection-&lt;date&gt;.xml files) until it takes 20MB on the disk.
You can parameter backup in the Parameter view / Advanced tab. It is
very unlikely to append but if your collection is corrupted, stop
Jajuk, overwrite the collection.xml file by the backup file of your
choice and start Jajuk again.<br>
<br>
<h2>Basic files</h2>
Note that Jajuk can also read files that are not referenced in a
device. They are called "basic files" and are mainly used when creating
playlists. We don't recommand to use them because you will loose many
functionnailities. You can play a basic file by "File - &gt; Open"
function from the Command view at the top of the Window.<br>
