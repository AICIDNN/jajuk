<H1>Using Devices</H1>
<H2>Definition</H2>
<P>Jajuk plays music from devices. A device is a set of audio files.
It can be : 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">A directory 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">A data CD-ROM 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">An External Hard Disk 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">A Physical Player like an iPod 
	</P>
	<LI><P>A Remote directory (not yet implemented) 
	</P>
</UL>
<P><U>Note</U>: In all cases except remote, devices are regular
directories from the OS point of view but Jajuk makes the difference
to deal with particularities (for instance, a CD-ROM is read-only)
and to provide a friendlier graphical interface.</P>
<P>A device usually contains MP3, OGG and others supported audio
files, M3P files for playlists and JPG, GIF and others supported
image files for covers.</P>
<P>What we name a collection is the combination of devices you
created.</P>
<H2>Refreshing devices</H2>
<P>Under Jajuk, devices should be refreshed from times to times.
Indeed, what's make Jajuk so fast is its collection index: music
files are not scanned and their tags not read at each startup but
Jajuk builds a collection or index during refresh (stored on the disk
as {home directory}/.jajuk/collection.xml). It allows Jajuk to start
and be aware of all tracks from a multi 100GB of music collection in
only few seconds. It is also used to perform searches and filtering
on the entire collection in real time.</P>
<P>Jajuk only knows files from refreshed devices: if you copy a file
on your disk, Jajuk will know it only after the source device
refresh.</P>
<P>Devices can be refreshed at each startup but it is not recommended
because of the spaces of time. Note however that Jajuk integrates
some optimizations that greatly accelerates refreshing: by default,
Jajuk doesn't read tags for known files. You can force it to read
them with the &quot;Force tag read&quot; option in Parameter View /
Option tab if you changed tags using another application.</P>
<P>You can refresh a device from the physical perspective with
&quot;Refresh&quot; command from contextual menu on selected device
or from <A HREF="view_devices.html">the Device view</A> in the
Configuration perspective.</P>
<H2>Mounting/unmouting devices</H2>
<P>Mounting a device means to make it available and unmounting it
means to disconnect it. It is near the Unix mount notion. You can
configure devices in the Device view so they will be automatically
mounted at startup. Some device can naturally be auto-mounted: a
directory from your internal hard disk for example. On the other
hand, we highly discourage to auto-mount some others like CD or USB
keys because they are likely to be unavailable at next startup. When
a mount is required on a device, Jajuk will check it is physically
available (for a CD for instance) and try to access it if required.
Under Unix, it can eventually perform a &quot;mount&quot; command. If
you try to play a track located in an unmounted device, Jajuk will
ask you if you want it to mount this device. In all cases, you will
get an error message if the device cannot be mounted.</P>
<P>You can mount or unmount a device from the physical perspective
with &quot;Mount or Unmount&quot; commands from contextual menu on
selected device or from <A HREF="view_devices.html">the Device view</A>
in the Configuration perspective.</P>
<H2>Synchronizing devices</H2>
<P>When creating a device (see device view documentation for more
information), you can tell Jajuk to make it synchronized with another
device. This allows you to copy by a single click all the new files
from source device to the other. Note that you can perform partial
synchronization by desynchronizing some directories in the Physical
perspective / Physical tree and contextual menu on directories (watch
the selection box in the Information view at the bottom to know
recursive size of a selection). You can also perform bidirectional
synchronizations (all new files from a device are copied to the
other) and not only unidirectional.</P>
<P>You can synchronize two devices from the physical perspective with
&quot;Synchronize&quot; command from contextual menu on selected
device or from <A HREF="view_devices.html">the Device view</A> in the
Configuration perspective.</P>
<H2>Collection backup</H2>
<P>All your collection and properties on your tracks are stored in
the collection file ({home directory}/.jajuk/collection.xml file). By
default Jajuk performs a backup of this collection file
(collection-&lt;date&gt;.xml files) until it takes 20MB on the disk.
You can parameter backup in the Parameter view / Advanced tab. It is
very unlikely to append but if your collection is corrupted, stop
Jajuk, overwrite the collection.xml file by the backup file of your
choice and start Jajuk again.</P>
<H2>Basic files</H2>
<P>Note that Jajuk can also read files that are not referenced in a
device. They are called &quot;basic files&quot; and are mainly used
when creating playlists. We discourage you to use them because you
will loose a lot of features. You can play a basic file by &quot;File
-&gt; Open&quot; function from the Command view at the top of the
Window.</P>
