<H1>The Physical/Logical Table view</H1>
<P>These views show all files/tracks from your collection in a table
and is used to perform contextual operations and filtering. For the
moment, columns (track name, directory...) are static but in Jajuk
future releases, you should be able to add new custom ones. Physical
Table view displays all files from your collection (so you can get
several time the same file if located in several devices or
directories) when the Logical Table view only deals with tracks and
related information. Note that a single track can actually map
several files but will only be displayed once in this view.</P>
<P><U>Notes</U>: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Rate is related to the track, not
	to a single file. It is computed this way: +1 when a track is added
	in queue and +2 when it is played. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>As usual, you can limit to files from mounted devices using
	the &quot;show only mounted devices&quot; option in Parameter view/
	Option tab.
