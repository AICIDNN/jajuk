<h1>The Physical/Logical Table view</h1>
<p>This two views shows all files/tracks from your collection in a table and is used to perform contextual operations and filtering. 
	For the moment, columns (track name, directory...) are static but in Jajuk future releases, you will be able to add new custom ones.
 Physical Table view displays all files from your collection (so you can get several time the same file if located in several devices or directories) when
 the Logical Table view only deals with tracks and related information. Note that a single track can actually map several files but will only be displayed once in this view.</p>
<p><u>Notes</u>: 
			<ul>
				<li>Rate is related to the track, not to a single file. It is computed this way: +1 when a track is added in queue and +2 when it is played.</li>
				<li>As usual, you can limit to files from mounted devices using the "show only mounted devices" option in Parameter view/ Option tab.</li>
			</ul>
</p>
<h2>Drag and Drop</h2>
<p>At any time, you can drag  a single file or track from the table to any Playlist in the Playlist repository view or to the current Playlist Editor.</p>
<h2>Contextual menu</h2>
<p>File contextual menu features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Play: Stop current track/file and play it</li>
  <li>Push: Don't stop current track but simply add the selection in the queue (see Queue playlist)</li>
  <li>Play shuffle: Stop current track and play selection randomly
(note that this mode is automatically taken when playing a track if you used Shuffle mode in command view)</li>
  <li>Play repeat: Stop current track and play selection in a loop (note that this mode is automatically taken when playing a track if you used
Repeat mode in command view)</li>
  <li>Set a property (not yet implemented). Set a property to this item</li>
  <li>Properties (not yet implemented). Show item properties.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Filtering panel</h2>
<p>To filter tracks/files following some criteria, select the criteria using the combo box (track name, author and so on), then type the filter value in the text field and type [enter]. 
	If filter value is void, all tracks/files will be displayed.</p>
<p>o Filter type combo box: select the criteria you want to filter on.
<p>o Filter value text field: type value you want to filter on.
