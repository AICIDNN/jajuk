<h1>The Help view</h1>
<p>This view provides Jajuk help system. For the moment, only two
languages are available : English and French (volontary translators are
welcomed). </p>
<p>It uses JavaHelp solution (<a

Basicaly, it features under Jajuk :</p>
<ul>
  <li>A control panel at the top to browse (previous/next)
documentation, to print it (print and printer configuration) and to add
current page as a favorite.</li>
  <li>A table of contents with ordered subjects. Click on the subject
to&nbsp; display it in the right window.</li>
  <li>A search panel to find pages which matches searched word.</li>
