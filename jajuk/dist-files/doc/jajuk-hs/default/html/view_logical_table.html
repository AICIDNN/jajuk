<h1>The Logical Table view</h1>
<p>This view shows all tracks from your collection in a table and allows to perform contuextual operations and filtering. 
	For the moment, columns (track name, album...) are static but in Jajuk future releases, you will be able to add new custom ones.</p>
<p><u>Notes</u>: 
			<ul>
				<li>Rate is related to the track, not to a single file. It is computed this way: +1 when a track is added in queue and +2 when it is played.</li>
				<li>As usual, you can limit to files from mounted devices using the "show only mounted devices" option in Parameter view/ Option tab.</li>
			</ul>
</p>
<h2>Drag and Drop</h2>
<p>At any time, you can drag  a single track from the table to any Playlist in the Playlist repository view or to the current Playlist Editor.</p>
<h2>Contextual menu</h2>
<p>Track contextual menu features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Play: Stop current track and play track</li>
  <li>Push: Don't stop current track but simply add the selection in
the queue (see Queue playlist)</li>
  <li>Play shuffle: Stop current track and play selection randomly
(note that this mode is automaticaly taken when playing a track if you

  <li>Play repeat: Stop current track and play selection in loop (note
that this mode is automaticaly taken when playing a track if you used
