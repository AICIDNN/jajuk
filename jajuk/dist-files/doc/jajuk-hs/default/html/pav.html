<h1>Perspectives and views</h1>


<h2>Definitions</h2>


<ul>


  <li>
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Jajuk is divided into
perspectives and views. A perspective is a logical set of views. For
instance, you can
display the physical perspective to navigate into disk files,
directories or the logical perspective to navigate into genres,
artists, albums and tracks. </p>


  </li>


  <li>
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">A view is located
inside a perspective and shows some linked information. For instance,
the Physical perspective contains both the Physical Tree view and the
Physical Table view. </p>


  </li>


  <li>
    
    <p>To change of current perspective, click on the perspective
icon of your choice in the Perspective Selector view (see figure 02). </p>


  </li>


</ul>

<p><b>Static views ( in all perspectives ) :</b><br>


1- Command view:
used to perform searches, to control music player (stop, pause...)
and sound (mute, volume), to navigate in the history, to set play
mode (repeat, shuffle...) and to access smart functions like 'best
of'.<br>


2- Perspective Selector: used to select current perspective
(see next paragraph).<br>


3- Information view: displays various
information, selection size, track quality, position in %...</p>


<p><b>Contextual views :</b><br>


4- This is a view example
(physical playlist editor) that you only find in the Physical
perspective.</p>


<h2>Jajuk perspectives</h2>


<p>Jajuk release contains following perspectives :</p>


<p><img alt="" src="../icons/40x40/perspective_physic.png" name="Image2" style="border: 0px solid ;">&nbsp;Physical
perspective: in this perspective, your collection is shown as it is
on your disks: files, directories, m3u files etc. All actions are
performed on an given physical file. This perspective is useful but
note that if you have several times the same track in different
devices (lets say one on your hard disk and one on a CD), you will
see it several times in all views. This is the same for playlist files.</p>


<p><img alt="" src="../icons/40x40/perspective_logic.png" name="Image3" style="border: 0px solid ;">&nbsp;Logical
perspective: in this perspective, your collection is shown following
id3 tags information like genres, artists, albums, tracks and logical
playlists (a logical playlist maps several identical physical m3u
playlists). This perspective is useful only if your collection is
correctly tagged, otherwise everything will be 'unknown'. In
opposition to the physical perspective, you now see tracks, not files.
A
track is a logical mapping to one or more files. It means you will
see a track only once even if you have several physical files for
this track. If you modify a logical playlist, all associated physical
playlists (.m3u files) will be modified together.</p>


<p><img alt="" src="../icons/40x40/perspective_player.png" name="Image4" style="border: 0px solid ;">&nbsp;Player
perspective: used to show various information while playing tracks:
one animation view with large text area to display track names and
two cover views.</p>


<p><img alt="" src="../icons/40x40/perspective_catalog.png" name="Image4" style="border: 0px solid ;">&nbsp;
<span lang="fr-FR">Catalog perspective: display
collection using interactive covers thumbnails.</span>
</p>


<p><img alt="" src="../icons/40x40/perspective_information.png" name="Image5" style="border: 0px solid ;">&nbsp;Configuration
perspective: this contains views to configure Jajuk (options) and to
create or modify devices. A device is a set of physical files (like a
directory on your hard disk, a CD, a music player...).</p>


<p><img alt="" src="../icons/40x40/perspective_stat.png" name="Image6" style="border: 0px solid ;">&nbsp;Statistics
perspective: contains various pies and histograms about your
collection: number of tracks, devices sizes, genres repartition,
collection size.</p>


<p><img alt="" src="../icons/40x40/perspective_help.png" name="Image7" style="border: 0px solid ;">&nbsp;Help
perspective: Jajuk help
and 'About' view providing various information on the project and the
runtime environment.</p>


<h2>Using docking</h2>


<p>Jajuk interface can be organized just like you want it: you
can
resize, minimize, drag a view and add it to another view as a tab, make view auto-hideable (using the drawing-pin)...&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can reset default views configuration by
using the top command view: Views -&gt; restore defaults.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Views
configuration are saved when closing Jajuk.</p>
