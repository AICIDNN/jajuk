<H1>Perspectives and views</H1>
<H2>Definitions</H2>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Jajuk is divided into perspectives
	and views. A perspective is a logical set of views. For instance,
	you are currently in the Help perspective and you would display the
	physical perspective to navigate into disk files, directories or the
	logical perspective to navigate into styles, authors, albums and
	tracks. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">A view is located inside a
	perspective and shows some linked information. For instance, the
	Physical perspective contains both the Physical Tree view and the
	Physical Table view. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">There are two types of views:
	static (command, information and perspective bar) that are displayed
	in all perspectives and contextual that are related to a
	perspective. Note that a same view (even contextual) can be found in
	several perspectives (Cover view for instance). 
	</P>
	<LI><P>To change of current perspective, click on the perspective
	icon of your choice in the Perspective Selector view (see figure
	02).

</P>
<P><B>Static views ( in all perspectives ) :</B><BR>1- Command view:
used to perform searches, to control music player (stop, pause...)
and sound (mute, volume), to navigate in the history, to set play
mode (repeat, shuffle...) and to access special functions like 'best
of'.<BR>2- Perspective Selector: used to select current perspective
(see next paragraph).<BR>3- Information view: displays various
information, selection size, track quality, position in %...</P>
<P><B>Contextual views :</B><BR>4- This is a contextual view example
(physical playlist editor) that you only find in the Physical
perspective.</P>
<H2>Jajuk perspectives</H2>
<P>Jajuk release contains following perspectives :</P>
<P><IMG SRC="../icons/16x16/physical_perspective.png" NAME="Image2" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=16 BORDER=0>&nbsp;Physical
perspective: In this perspective, your collection is shown as it is
on your disks: files, directories, m3u files etc. All actions are
performed on an given physical file. This perspective is useful but
note that if you have several times the same track in different
devices (lets say one on your hard disk and one on a CD), you will
see it twice in all views. This is the same for playlist files.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="../icons/16x16/logical_perspective.png" NAME="Image3" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=16 BORDER=0>&nbsp;Logical
perspective: In this perspective, your collection is shown following
id3 tags information like styles, authors, albums, tracks and logical
playlists (a logical playlist maps several identical physical m3u
playlists). This perspective is useful only if your collection is
correctly tagged, otherwise everything will be 'unknown'. In
opposition to the physical playlist, you now see tracks, not files. A
track is a logical mapping to one or more files. It means you will
see a track only once even if you have several physical files for
this track. If you modify a logical playlist, all associated physical
playlists (.m3u files) will be modified together.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="../icons/16x16/player_perspective.png" NAME="Image4" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=16 BORDER=0>&nbsp;Player
perspective: Used to show various information while playing tracks:
one animation view with large text area to display track names and
two cover views.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="../icons/16x16/configuration_perspective.png" NAME="Image5" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=16 BORDER=0>&nbsp;Configuration
perspective: This contains views to configure Jajuk (options) and to
create or modify devices. A device is a set of physical files (like a
directory on your hard disk, a CD, a music player...).</P>
<P><IMG SRC="../icons/16x16/statistics_perspective.png" NAME="Image6" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=16 BORDER=0>&nbsp;Statistics
perspective: Contains various pies and histograms about your
collection: number of tracks, devices sizes, style repartition,
collection size. More stats will be available in next releases.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="../icons/16x16/help_perspective.png" NAME="Image7" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=16 BORDER=0>&nbsp;Help
perspective: Should be this current perspective. Contains Jajuk help
and 'About' view providing various information on the project and the
runtime environment.</P>
<H2>Using docking</H2>
<P>Jajuk interface can be organized just like you want it: you can
resize, minimize, drag a view and add it to another view as a tab...
If you are in trouble, you can reset default views configuration by
using the top command view: Views -&gt; restore defaults. Of course,
your views positions and configurations are saved when closing Jajuk.</P>
