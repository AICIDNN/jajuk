<h1>Perspectives and views</h1>
<h2>Definitions</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Jajuk is divided into perspectives and views. A perspective is a
logical set of views. For
instance, you are currently in the Help perspective to get some help
and you will use physical perspective to navigate into disk files,
directories or&nbsp; logical perspective to navigate into styles,
authors, albums and tracks. </li>
  <li>A view is a way to show informations relative to a perspective.
For instance, you have both physical tree view and the physical table
view in the physical perspectives.</li>
  <li>There is two types of views : static ones ( command, information
and perspective bar ) which are present in all perspectives and
contextual ones which are related to a perspective. Note that a same view (
even regular ) can be found in several perspectives ( cover view for
instance ).</li>
  <li>To change current perspective, click on perspective icon of you
choice in the perspective bar view ( see figure 02 ).<br>
  </li>
</ul>

<i>Fig. 01 : views</i>
<p><b>Static views ( in all perspectives ) :</b><br>
1- Command view : allows user to perform searchs, to control music
player ( stop, pause...) and sound ( mute, volume) , to navigate
in the history, to set play mode ( repeat, shuffle...) and to access
special functions like 'best of'.<br>
2- Perspective bar : allows user to select current perspective ( see
next paragraph )<br>
3- Information view : displays various informations, selection size,
track quality, position in %...</p>
<p><b>Contextual views :</b><br>
4- This is a contextual view example ( physical playlist editor ) that you
only find in the physical perspective.</p>
<h2>Jajuk perspectives</h2>
<p>Jajuk release contains following perspectives :</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../icons/16x16/physical_perspective.png"
 style="width: 16px; height: 16px;">&nbsp;Physical perspective: In
this perspective, you see your collection as it is on your disks :
files, directories, m3u files etc...&nbsp; All actions are performed on
an identified physical file. This perspective is useful but has
a big disadvantage : if you have several times the same track in
different devices ( lets say one on your hard disk and one on a CD ),
you will see it twice in all views. This is the same for playlists.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../icons/16x16/logical_perspective.png"
 style="width: 16px; height: 16px;">&nbsp;Logical perspective: In this
perspective, you see your collection following id3 tags informations : as styles, authors, albums, tracks
and logical playlists ( a logical playlist maps several identical physical
m3u playlists). This perspective is&nbsp; useful only if your
collection is well tagged, otherwise everything will be ' unknown'. In
opposition to physical playlist, you now see tracks, not files. A track
is a logical mapping to one or more files. It means you will see a
track only once even if you have several physical files for this track.
If you modify a logical playlist, all associated physical playlists (
.m3u files ) will be modified together.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../icons/16x16/player_perspective.png"
 style="width: 16px; height: 16px;">&nbsp;Player perspective: Used to show
static information while playing tracks : one animation view with large
text area to display track name and two cover views.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../icons/16x16/configuration_perspective.png"
 style="width: 16px; height: 16px;">&nbsp;Configuration perspective:
This contains views to configure Jajuk (
options ) and to create or modify devices. A device is a set of
physical files ( like a directory on your hard disk, a CD, a music
player ...).</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../icons/16x16/statistics_perspective.png"
 style="width: 16px; height: 16px;">&nbsp;Statistics perspective: Contains various pies and histograms about
your collection : number of tracks, devices sizes, style repartition,
collection size. More stats will be available in next releases.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../icons/16x16/help_perspective.png"
 style="width: 16px; height: 16px;">&nbsp;Help perspective: Should be this current perspective. Contains
Jajuk help and a 'About' view giving various informations on the
project and the runtime environment.</p>
<h2>Using docking</h2>
<p>Jajuk interface can be organize just like you want: you can resize,
minimize, drag a view and add it to another view as a tab... If you are
in trouble, you can reset default views configuration by using the top
command view : Views-&gt; restore defaults. Of course, your views
positions and configurations are saved when closing Jajuk.</p>
