<h1>Perspectives and views</h1>
<h2>Definitions</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Jajuk is divided into perspectives and views. A perspective is a
logical set of views. For
instance, you are currently in the Help perspective and you would display the physical perspective to navigate into disk files,
directories or the logical perspective to navigate into styles, authors, albums and tracks. </li>
  <li>A view is located inside a perspective and shows some linked information. For instance, the Physical perspective contains both the Physical Tree view 
  and the Physical Table view.</li>
  <li>There are two types of views: static (command, information and perspective bar) that are displayed in all perspectives and 
  contextual that are related to a perspective. Note that a same view (even contextual) can be found in several perspectives 
  (Cover view for instance).</li>
  <li>To change the current perspective, click on perspective icon of you choice in the Perspective Selector view (see figure 02).</li>
</ul>

<i>Fig. 01: views</i>
<p><b>Static views ( in all perspectives ) :</b><br>
1- Command view: used to perform searches, to control music player (stop, pause...) and sound (mute, volume), 
to navigate in the history, to set play mode (repeat, shuffle...) and to access special functions like 'best of'.<br>
2- Perspective Selector: used to select current perspective (see next paragraph).<br>
3- Information view: displays various information, selection size, track quality, position in %...</p>
<p><b>Contextual views :</b><br>
4- This is a contextual view example (physical playlist editor) that you only find in the Physical perspective.</p>
<h2>Jajuk perspectives</h2>
<p>Jajuk release contains following perspectives :</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../icons/16x16/physical_perspective.png"
 style="width: 16px; height: 16px;">&nbsp;Physical perspective: In this perspective, your collection is shown as it 
 is on your disks: files, directories, m3u files etc. All actions are performed on an given physical file. 
 This perspective is useful but note that if you have several times the same track in different devices 
 (lets say one on your hard disk and one on a CD), you will see it twice in all views. This is the same for playlist files.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../icons/16x16/logical_perspective.png"
 style="width: 16px; height: 16px;">&nbsp;Logical perspective: In this perspective, your collection is shown following 
 id3 tags information like styles, authors, albums, tracks and logical playlists (a logical playlist maps several
  identical physical m3u playlists). This perspective is useful only if your collection is correctly tagged, otherwise 
  everything will be 'unknown'. In opposition to the physical playlist, you now see tracks, not files. A track is a logical 
  mapping to one or more files. It means you will see a track only once even if you have several physical files for this track. 
  If you modify a logical playlist, all associated physical playlists (.m3u files) will be modified together.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../icons/16x16/player_perspective.png"
 style="width: 16px; height: 16px;">&nbsp;Player perspective: Used to show various information while playing tracks: 
 one animation view with large text area to display track names and two cover views.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../icons/16x16/configuration_perspective.png"
 style="width: 16px; height: 16px;">&nbsp;Configuration perspective: This contains views to configure Jajuk (options) and to 
 create or modify devices. A device is a set of physical files (like a directory on your hard disk, a CD, a music player...).</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../icons/16x16/statistics_perspective.png"
 style="width: 16px; height: 16px;">&nbsp;Statistics perspective: Contains various pies and histograms about your collection: 
 number of tracks, devices sizes, style repartition, collection size. More stats will be available in next releases.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../icons/16x16/help_perspective.png"
 style="width: 16px; height: 16px;">&nbsp;Help perspective: Should be this current perspective. Contains Jajuk help and 'About' 
 view providing various information on the project and the runtime environment.</p>
<h2>Using docking</h2>
<p>Jajuk interface can be organized just like you want it: you can resize, minimize, drag a view and add it to another 
view as a tab... If you are in trouble, you can reset default views configuration by using the top command view: 
Views -&gt; restore defaults. Of course, your views positions and configurations are saved when closing Jajuk.</p>
