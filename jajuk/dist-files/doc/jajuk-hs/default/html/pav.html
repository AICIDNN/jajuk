<h1>Perspectives and views</h1>
<h2>Definitions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Jajuk is devided into perspectives and views. A perspective is a
set of views.</li>
  <li>A perspective is a way of seeing ressources managed by Jajuk. For
instance, you are currently in the Help perspective to get some help or
you will use physical perspective to navigate into disk files,
directories and logical perspective to navigate into styles, authors,
albims and tracks.</li>
  <li>A view is a way to show informations relative to a perspective.
For instance, you have both physical tree view and the physical table
view&nbsp; in the physical perspectives.</li>
  <li>There is two types of views : static ones ( command, information
and perspective bar ) which are present in all persptives and regular
ones whish are related to a perspective.&nbsp; Note that a same view (
even regular ) can be found in several perspectives ( cover view for
instance ). <br>
  </li>
  <li>To change current perspective, clic on perstective icon of you
choice in the perspective bar view.<br>

<h2>Jajuk perspectives</h2>
Current Jajuk release contains five perspectives :<br>
<br>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" border="0"
 style="text-align: left; width: 100%;">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;"><img
 src="../../images/pav02_2.jpg" alt=""
 style="width: 300px; height: 300px;"><br>
Fig. 02 : perspectives<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">1- Physical perspective : In
this perspective, you see your collection as it is on your disks :
files, directories, m3u files etc...&nbsp; All actions are performed on
an identified physical file. This perspective is pretty useful but has
a big disadvantage : if you have several times the same track in
different devices ( lets say once on your hard disk, once on a CD ),
you will see it twice in all views. This is the same for playlists.<br>
      <br>
2- Logical perspective : In this perspective, you see your collection
folowing id3 tags informations : as styles, authors, albums, tracks and
logical playlists ( a logical playlist maps several identical physical
m3u playlists). This perspective is&nbsp; usefull only if your
collection is well taged, otherwise everything will be ' unknown'. In
opposition to physical playlist, you now see tracks, not files. A track
is a logical mapping to one or more files. It means you will see a
track only once even if you have several physical files for this track.
If you modify a logical playlist, all associated physical playlists (
.m3u files ) will be modified together.<br>
      <br>
3- Configuration perspective : This contains views to configure Jajuk (
options ) and to create or modify devices. A device is a set of
physical files ( like a directory on your hard disk, a CD, a music
player ...).<br>
      <br>
4- Statistics perspective : Contains various pies and histograms about
your collection : number of tracks, devices sizes, style repartition,
collection size. More stats will be available in next releases.<br>
      <br>
5- Help perspective : Should be this current perspective. Contains
Jajuk help and a 'About' view giving various informations on the
project and the runtime environment.<br>
