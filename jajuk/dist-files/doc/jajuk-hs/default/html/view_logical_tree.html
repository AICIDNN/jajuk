<h1>The Logical Tree view</h1>
<p>This view is located in the Logical perspective. It allows you selecting or browsing your devices 
	upon a logical (style/author/album/track) point of view. In this view, you will find:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Styles (like Rock, POP, Classic...).</li>
  <li>Authors</li>
  <li>Albums</li>
  <li>Tracks (note that a single track can map several identical files)</li>
</ul>
<u>Notes</u>:
<ul>
  <li>Cover and playlist files are not visible in the tree.</li>
  <li>Tree configuration (nodes expands/collapses) is saved for next
Jajuk session.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can select any item in the tree, all contextual menu actions will be
applied recursively. For example, if you selected both "Acoustic" and "Blues" styles, then you right click and
select "Play shuffle", Jajuk will play randomly all your Acoustic and Blues tracks.</p>
<h2>Dragging and dropping items</h2>
<p>At any time, you can drag a selection and drop it over the playlist you
want to add selection to (in Playlist Repository view) or over the
Playlist Editor View of current Playlist. If current playlist is the
queue Playlist (default), a drag on the selection and drop over the
Playlist Editor View will result into an immediate playing of your
selection.</p>
