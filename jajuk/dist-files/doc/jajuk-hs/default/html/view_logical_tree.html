<H1>The Logical Tree view</H1>

	Classic...).

	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Albums

	next Jajuk session. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>You can select any item in the tree, all contextual menu actions
will be applied recursively. For example, if you selected both
&quot;Acoustic&quot; and &quot;Blues&quot; styles, then you right
click and select &quot;Play shuffle&quot;, Jajuk will play randomly
all your Acoustic and Blues tracks.</P>
<H2>Dragging and dropping items</H2>
<P>At any time, you can drag a selection and drop it over the
playlist you want to add selection to (in Playlist Repository view)
or over the Playlist Editor View of current Playlist. If current
playlist is the queue Playlist (default), a drag on the selection and
drop over the Playlist Editor View will result into an immediate
playing of your selection.</P>
