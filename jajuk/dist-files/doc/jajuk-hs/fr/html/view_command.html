<H1>The command view 
</H1>
<P>The command view is located at the top of Jajuk window. It is a
static view that is always visible in all perspectives. It is used to
control the player and perform searches.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="../images/command_01.jpg" NAME="Image1" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=1149 HEIGHT=51 BORDER=0><BR><I>Fig.
01: Command view</I></P>
<H2>Menu</H2>
<P>File</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; File -&gt; Open File (Alt-f): Allows
opening one or more tracks (we call them basic tracks because they
may not be indexed in collection). You can choose any music files
from your disks, not only those from your devices. Note however that
this function is not recommended because basic tracks will show less
information and will not be added in the history bar. When opened,
the tracks are played immediately, not pushed.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; File -&gt; Exit (Alt-x): Quit Jajuk. Note
you can also exit Jajuk by simply closing the Window or using the
tray.</P>
<P>Views -&gt; Restore defaults: Reorganize views as shipped by
authors.</P>
<P>Properties -&gt; Not yet implemented, will be used to create and
manage custom properties</P>
<P>Mode -&gt; Controls for modes ( repeat, shuffle, continue, intro).
Same as two-states buttons bellow.</P>
<P>Help</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Help -&gt; Contents: show Help view.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Help -&gt; About: show <A HREF="view_about.html">the
About view</A> with credentials and system information.</P>
<H2>Search box and history bar</H2>
<P><IMG SRC="../images/pm06.jpg" NAME="Image6" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=539 HEIGHT=250 BORDER=0><BR><I>Fig.
02: Selecting a track with command view</I></P>
<P><B>Using search box(1):</B></P>
<P>The search box can be used to find any file, track, style, author,
album... for a given text. A result popup appears. Then launch the
track by clicking on the list: the track will be played immediately.</P>
<P><B>Using history bar(2):</B> 
</P>
<P>The history bar shows all tracks you played (can be cleared and
configured in the Parameter view). Click on one track to launch it
again. Note that tracks in the history bar may be on devices that are
no more mounted. In this case, Jajuk will ask you to mount them if
available.</P>
<H2>Modes</H2>
<P>Modes set the player behavior when selected before and during the
play. All combinations of modes are allowed. Note that you can see
which tracks are repeated thanks special icons in the playlist editor
view.</P>

will be played in a loop. If it is checked during a play, only
