<P>If you don't understand Jajuk device notions like mounting,

Devices page</A>.</P>
<P>This window appears when you create a new device or when you
update some properties of an existing device. You can show device
properties by double clicking on it, by using contextual menu/ Get
Properties or by selecting the device and using the Properties button
in the Control Pane. It features:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Device type combo box (Cannot be
	changed after creation): choose the device type you wish to create. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Device name (Cannot be changed
	after creation): Enter name of the device. For example &quot;CD A&quot;
	for a CD or &quot;Laptop&quot; for a directory. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Device location (Cannot be changed
	after creation): full path to the device. For example &quot;/data/music&quot;
	under Unix or &quot;d:\music&quot; under Windows. You can use the
	directory selector using the button on the right. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Unix mount point (only under
	Linux/Unix). This is optional and allows Jajuk trying to perform a
	system &quot;mount&quot; command if required when mounting a device.
	For example, if you want to mount a CD device whose Unix mount point
	is /mnt/cdrom and that CD is not Unix mounted, Jajuk will try to
	mount it by itself. Note however that this should be useless with
	last Linux distributions that perform auto-mount. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;Perform an instant refresh&quot;
	(default): Perform a device refresh immediately after creating the
	device. This is recommended. Note that this should take a while,
	especially for the first time. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;Auto mount at startup&quot;
	(checked by default for directories, unchecked by default for all
	others devices): Perform an auto-mount when starting Jajuk. This is
	recommended for directories or eventually external devices if always
	plugged but avoid this for CD or devices that can be unplugged or
	changed quite often. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Synchronized with combo box: If
	you have more than one device, you will be able to synchronize them.
	The current device is the target device and the other one the source
	device. 
	</P>
	<UL>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;Unidirectional
		synchronization&quot;: all new files from the source device are
		copied to this device. 
		</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;Bidirectional
		synchronization&quot;: all new files from one device are copied to
		the other.

	</P>
	<UL>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">You can ignore recursively some
		directories when performing synchronization (if the two
		synchronized devices have not the same capacity for example) by
		desynchronizing directories in the Physical tree/ contextual menu
		on directories. 
		</P>
		<LI><P>Synchronization never performs deletes so if you renames
		some files on the source device, you will get both older and newer
		version in the target device after synchronization.
