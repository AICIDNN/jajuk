******************************************
Hi, thanks for your proposition.

Now the perfect process could be:
o Read all interesting materials : specs, web site, javadoc
o Read developer guide on the web site and make a CVS checkout
o Have a look at the code
o Tell us if you still feel OK to work on jajuk

if yes:
o Give me your sourceforge user so I will give you commit right.
o Subscribe to the developer list, jajuk main communication stream.
o Choose one or more tasks from task list (you can asign them to yourself)
o Keep us in touch by giving an approximatical planning and % realized so we can plan releases.
o In you have questions/problems, don't hesitate to tell me and to ask on the developer list.

Thanks, CU
