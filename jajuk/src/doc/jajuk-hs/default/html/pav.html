>&#13;Jajuk is divided into perspectives and views. A perspective is a logical set of views. For instance, you can display the physical perspective to navigate into disk files, directories or the logical perspective to navigate into genres, artists, albums and tracks.

 Physical perspective: in this perspective, your collection is shown as it is on your disks: files, directories, m3u files etc. All actions are performed on an given physical file. This perspective is useful but note that if you have several times the same track in different devices (lets say one on your hard disk and one on a CD), you will see it several times in all views. This is the same for playlist files.

 Logical perspective: in this perspective, your collection is shown following id3 tags information like genres, artists, albums, tracks and logical playlists (a logical playlist maps several identical physical m3u playlists). This perspective is useful only if your collection is correctly tagged, otherwise everything will be 'unknown'. In opposition to the physical perspective, you now see tracks, not files. A track is a logical mapping to one or more files. It means you will see a track only once even if you have several physical files for this track. If you modify a logical playlist, all associated physical playlists (.m3u files) will be modified together.
