<h1>
view playlists</h1>
<p>
Go back to <a href="table_of_contents.html">
table of contents</a>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
The Playlist view intends to create, change or read playlists. </p>
<h2>
Different types of items</h2>
<p>
Jajuk manages two types of playlists : </p>
<ul>
<li>
Regular playlists (.m3u files only for now)</li>
<li>
Smart build-in playlists (New, Best-of, Novelties, Bookmarks) automatically and dynamically created by Jajuk and that you can save or play. Further information about smart playlists is available on the <a href="using_playlists.html">
using playlists</a>
 page.</li>
</ul>
<h2>
The two main parts of the Playlist view</h2>
<p>
The view is composed of two main parts splited vertically. </p>
<ul>
<li>
The upper part shows smart playlists as icons and a table of regular playlists (can be filtered like in others Jajuk tables). <ul>
<li>
Like every where else in jajuk, you can launch a playlist by double clicking on the row or using contextual menu. </li>
<li>
Contextual menu on the table rows or on the smart playlists brings others features like delete, push, play repeat, play shuffle, properties or save.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
The lower part display a table containing the content of the selected playlist (at view startup, default playlist is a void "New" playlist)<ul>
<li>
This part is very similar to the <a href="queue_view.html">
Queue view</a>
. </li>
<li>
The main difference is the presence of the Prepare part <a href="../images/3/34/Ext_drive_16x16.png" title="image:ext_drive_16x16.png" class="internal">
<img src='../images/3/34/Ext_drive_16x16.png' alt="image:ext_drive_16x16.png"/>
</a>
 feature that create a directory with the playlist and all the tracks that the playlist contains at a glance. A new folder "Collection-ddMMyyyy-HH:mm" will be created in the selected device with all the audio files along with a playlist file (*.m3u).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Other tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>
You can also add new files in the playlists by drag and drop from tree or table views.</li>
<li>
You can select columns you want to display or hide by clicking on top/right icon of the table.</li>
</ul>
