Installation Guides</a>
</p>
<h3>
Do you plan to read video and pictures etc... with Jajuk and make it a media center ?</h3>
<p>
It is very unlikely. We want to make a jukebox with as many features as we can for advanced users. We want to manage Music and make it right.</p>
<h2>
Technical</h2>
<h3>
How to select sound device in case of multiple sound cards ?</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Note that the multiple sound cards support will be enhanced in future releases (probably 1.4)</li>
<li>
[Linux users] In the mean time, install mplayer (if you don't have it yet) and configure your default sound card in $HOME/.mplayer/config (e.g.: ao=alsa:device=hw=0.3). You can use 'aplay -l' to list your sound devices.</li>
<li>
[Windows, Jajuk 1.4 dev minimum] : In Parameter view / Advanced tab, change "Sound engine" option and add "-ao dsound:device=&lt;1, 2 or any other device id&gt;"</li>
<li>
Note: If your are no using your second card, why not deactivate it in your BIOS?</li>
</ul>
<h3>
How much resources uses Jajuk ?</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Please read the <a href="performance_tips.html">
Performance tips</a>
 in the embedded help system</li>
<li>
On a recently manufactured PC, Jajuk uses less than 5% CPU and typically from 40 to 70 MB of memory for a 50 GB collection</li>
</ul>
<h3>
(Windows) How to map statically a letter to a drive ?</h3>
<ul>
<li>
This can be useful to create jajuk devices mapped to a drive letter one time for ever (exemple: first external hard drive = M:, second external hard drive = N:)</li>
<li>
Check this <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/dm_drive_letter.mspx?mfr=true">
Microsoft page</a>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3>
All Operating systems</h3>
<h4>
I experience sound skips</h4>
<ul>
<li>
(Linux and MacOS only, mplayer is provided with Windows distribution) Install mplayer (see Category:Installation_Guides)</li>
<li>
If you can't install mplayer and you use Jajuk &gt;= 1.4.2, use this settings in jajuk script : -client -Xms35M -Xmx256M -XX:MinHeapFreeRatio=20 -XX:MaxHeapFreeRatio=30 -Xincgc -XX:NewRatio=12</li>
</ul>
<h4>
I experience Out Of Memory issues</h4>
<p>
By default, Jajuk can use from 35MB to 512MB of physical memory. That should be large enough for most users. If you have a really huge collection and experience out-of-memory problems, increase the -Xmx value in the Jajuk launch script (open a support ticket if you need help)</p>
<h4>
What can I do if my collection looks *really* corrupted ?</h4>
<p>
Check out <a href="http://jajuk.info/index.php/Using_devices#Collection_backup_and_restore">
the device page of the jajuk manual</a>
. Note that this case has never been reported so far as Jajuk provides an efficient build-in recovery system.</p>
<h3>
Windows Only</h3>
<h4>
A "pop" (think "standard windows 'pop' sound") is heard between tracks</h4>
<p>
It's a sound emitted by the system when opening the systray balloons. We can't disable this sound as it is managed by Windows itself. You can:</p>
<ul>
<li>
either removing popup display in Jajuk (Parameter view in 1.3 - Preferences view in 1.4 / Options / Display popup). This option is available directly from the tray from 1.4.</li>
<li>
or disable it manually from Windows Sounds Parameters wizards (Parameters / sound and multimedia / disable "notify new messages" sound)</li>
</ul>
<h4>
Firefox is set as default browser, I use JRE 1.6 Sun and I regularly get this message: "java.net.MalformedURLException: unknown protocol: socket"</h4>
<ul>
<li>
See http://forum.java.sun.com/thread.jspa?threadID=5127788</li>
<li>
This is a Sun JRE 1.6 issue dealing with proxy settings. To fix it :</li>
</ul>
<p>
1) go to Control Panel -&gt; Java2) click the Network Settings button3) Select Direct Connection, and click ok a couple of times to exit</p>
<h4>
Cannot run Jajuk on Vista 64 bits (cannot execute 32 bits dll)</h4>
<p>
(Thanks elefkof SF user)You need to install both a 32-bit and 64-bits JRE. It will allow you to have a 64-bit and 32-bit versions alongside each other. It will use the 32-bit JRE for 32 bit apps and 64 bit JRE for 64 bit apps. See http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4802695</p>
<h4>
Access is denied under Vista</h4>
<ul>
<li>
I get this error message: java.io.FileNotFoundException: C:\Program Files (x86)\Jajuk\bin\JIntellitype.dll (Access is denied) when launching java installer under a Vista 64 bit</li>
<li>
Workaround: Run the installer as an administrator. That should work. (thanks kawayanuuc )</li>
</ul>
<h4>
Conflict between Web Start install and .Exe installer</h4>
<p>
If you launch Jajuk in Web start mode (Try it live), icons and startup menus are created. After installing Jajuk from the download jajuk-&lt;version&gt;-win32.exe file, launching Jajuk from the new created icon still executes the Web start version.</p>
<ul>
<li>
As a workaround, remove the Web start version from Start -&gt; Parameters -&gt; Configuration Panel -&gt; Java -&gt; "Display" in Temporary Internet files panel, select Jajuk application and remove it.</li>
<li>
Then you can try again Web start version, it uses a separated menu entry (Jajuk-Webstart) to avoid conflicts.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Linux Only</h3>
<h4>
After setting a cross-fade, the next track cannot start</h4>
<p>
This can be caused by a wrong mplayer configuration that uses OSS or ALSA and not the sound engine that prevents from playing several songs together. Edit ~/.mplayer/conf and add a line like 'ao=esd' under Gnome or 'ao=arts' under KDE.</p>
<h4>
I get totally or partially blank screens when using XGL</h4>
<p>
If under JRE 1.5, it may help to set this environment variable: AWT_TOOLKIT=MToolkit. Otherwise (not tested), try using xnest (install it if required). That should start Jajuk using a generic X configuration using 'Xnest :1 & DISPLAY=":1" jajuk'</p>
<h4>
My frame position and size is not kept between sessions or the frame is displayed at wrong position</h4>
<ul>
<li>
Under some new Window Manager or graphical environements like XGL, frame size and position cannot be set properly due to various bugs in them. In these cases, we ignore previous session sizes and we set a fixed one that should fit most screen. If it is not the case, you can set a custom forced size by editing (jajuk closed) the &lt;home&gt;/.jajuk/conf.properties file and set a value in the jajuk.frame.forced_position line (format:x,y,width,height, example: jajuk.frame.forced_position=50,50,1350,1000 ).</li>
<li>
This should <i>
not</i>
 append under Windows, OSX and Linux with Xorg/Xfree, otherwise, please open a ticket</li>
</ul>
<h4>
Jajuk blank frame and other various graphical issues using Beryl WM</h4>
<p>
This is caused by an incompatibility between Sun JRE and Beryl. If under JRE 1.6, you can use :</p>
<ul>
<li>
Either <a href="http://wiki.beryl-project.org/wiki/Java">
this fix</a>
</li>
<li>
Or <a href="http://www.vikrammohan.com/blog/2006/12/31/how-to-make-java-swing-work-on-beryl-with-aiglx/">
|using nested X servers</a>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>
Cross fade doesn't work under Linux (two mplayer processes cannot be launched concurrently)</h4>
<ul>
<li>
Under KDE, enable the sound server (artsd) from the KDE control center. Under Gnome, add this line in the ~/.mplayer/config file: "ao=esd" to use the Gnome sound server</li>
</ul>
<h4>
Mplayer is not available and I get an "audio line occupied" message</h4>
<p>
Try stopping all audio apps, check mute mode is not enable, check nothing users /dev/dsp (fuser /dev/dsp as root). If you still have the issue, it is probably an Alsa deamon problem, please read <a href="http://forum.ubuntu-fr.org/viewtopic.php?id=12019">
&lt;span class="icon"&gt;http://forum.ubuntu-fr.org/viewtopic.php?id=12019&lt;/span&gt;</a>
 this doc.</p>
<h4>
Problems displaying non-latin characters</h4>
<p>
The problem may be with with xorg's locales (see <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=301467&amp;highlight=java+text+input">
this thread</a>
). For russian for ie, the cure is:</p>
<pre>
sudo ln -s /usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8 /usr/share/X11/locale/ru_RU.UTF-8
</pre>
<h4>
I experience sound skips</h4>
<p>
Make sure to use mplayer if under Linux or Mac OSX</p>
