>&#13;When looking for local covers, Jajuk takes all supported (see Supported formats page) image files found in the current directory but also in all directories of the track. For instance, if you play a track from your hard disk and this file is also on a mounted CD with different covers, Jajuk will display all of them. It is useful because this way, you can save covers (see later) without having to mind on which device you saved them.

 Make current cover the default cover so it will be displayed the first if you don't use the Cover shuffle option (is the default). If the cover is a remote cover not already on the disk, it will be downloaded and saved first.

>&#13;o Size(L or @): Gives size in KB of this image. A 'L' means it 's a local image and a '@' means it's a remote image.
</P
><P
>&#13;o x/y: Gives current index over total number of covers available.
</P
><P
>&#13;o Search type (Low accuracy, Medium accuracy, High accuracy, Artist, Album and Title): Set accuracy for remote covers (used only if you use the Auto-cover feature, this is the default). Low, medium and high accuracy performs search on both the artist and the album names. The difference is than the more the accuracy will be high, the less you will get covers but the more the chance of getting a right cover is high. Artists, Album and Title only perform searches respectively on the artist, the album and the track title.

>&#13;In the Player perspective, you will find two cover views. By default, one is configured to display artist-related covers and the other one album-related covers. It should be the best way to display covers when playing. If you like this feature, we advice you to set the "shuffle covers" and "Load cover at each track" options.<PRE
