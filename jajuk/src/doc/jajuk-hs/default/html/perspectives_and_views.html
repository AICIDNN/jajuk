Perspectives and views</h1>
<h2>
Definitions</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Jajuk is divided into perspectives and views. A perspective is a logical set of views. For instance, you can display the physical perspective to navigate into disk files, directories or the logical perspective to navigate into genres, artists, albums and tracks.</li>
<li>
A view is located inside a perspective and shows some linked information. For instance, the Physical perspective contains both the Physical Files Tree view and the Physical Files Table view.</li>
<li>
To change of current perspective, click on the perspective icon of your choice in the Perspective Selector view (see figure 02).</li>
</ul>

Static views ( in all perspectives ) :</b>
 1- Command view: used to perform searches, to control music player (stop, pause...) and sound (mute, volume), to navigate in the history, to set play mode (repeat, shuffle...) and to access smart functions like 'best of'. 2- Perspective Selector: used to select current perspective (see next paragraph). 3- Information view: displays various information, selection size, track quality, position in %...</p>
<p>
<b>
Contextual views :</b>
 4- This is a view example (physical playlist editor) that you only find in the Physical perspective.</p>
<h2>
Jajuk perspectives</h2>
<p>
Jajuk release contains following perspectives :</p>
<p>
<a href="../images/3/36/Perspective_physic.png" title="Image:perspective_physic.png" class="internal">

</a>
 Physical perspective: in this perspective, your collection is shown as it is on your disks: files, directories, m3u files etc. All actions are performed on an given physical file. This perspective is useful but note that if you have several times the same track in different devices (lets say one on your hard disk and one on a CD), you will see it several times in all views. This is the same for playlist files.</p>
<p>
<a href="../images/6/66/Perspective_logic.png" title="Image:perspective_logic.png" class="internal">
<img src='../images/6/66/Perspective_logic.png' alt="Image:perspective_logic.png"/>
</a>
 Logical perspective: in this perspective, your collection is shown following id3 tags information like genres, artists, albums, tracks and logical playlists (a logical playlist maps several identical physical m3u playlists). This perspective is useful only if your collection is correctly tagged, otherwise everything will be 'unknown'. In opposition to the physical perspective, you now see tracks, not files. A track is a logical mapping to one or more files. It means you will see a track only once even if you have several physical files for this track. If you modify a logical playlist, all associated physical playlists (.m3u files) will be modified together.</p>

</a>
 Configuration perspective: this contains views to configure Jajuk (options) and to create or modify devices. A device is a set of physical files (like a directory on your hard disk, a CD, a music player...).</p>
<p>
<a href="../images/e/e4/Perspective_stat.png" title="Image:perspective_stat.png" class="internal">
<img src='../images/e/e4/Perspective_stat.png' alt="Image:perspective_stat.png"/>

<p>
<a href="../images/2/24/Perspective_help.png" title="Image:perspective_help.png" class="internal">
<img src='../images/2/24/Perspective_help.png' alt="Image:perspective_help.png"/>

<h2>
Using docking</h2>
<p>
Jajuk interface can be organized just like you want it: you can resize, minimize, drag a view and add it to another view as a tab, make view auto-hideable (using the drawing-pin)...</p>
<p>
You can reset default views configuration by using the top command view: Views -&gt; restore defaults.</p>
<p>
