This view simply displays all available playlists. It features smart playlists (Queue, Bestof, New, Bookmarks and Novelties) and regular ones. Physical Playlist Repository view only shows playlist files and Logical Playlist Repository only shows logical playlists (one playlist can map several playlist files). Further information about playlists on the [up.html Using Playlist page].</p>

















<p>

















Please note that this view is hidden by default (it is accessible by moving the mouse over the left-side tab). You can make it always visible using the drawing-pin.</p>
