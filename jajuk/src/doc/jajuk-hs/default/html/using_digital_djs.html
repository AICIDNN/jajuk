<h2>
What's a digital DJ ?</h2>
<p>
A digital DJ is just like a real one: it generates music playlists according to rules (kind of public, atmosphere, transitions...). Listening the collection using the shuffle mode is nice but not smart enough to produce a really good party time. Using DJs will allow you to delegate all the programing stuff to your favorite jukebox !</p>
<h2>
What's an ambience ?</h2>
<p>
DJs can use the concept of ambience. An ambience is simply a set of music genres. For example, "Techno" ambience can group Euro-Techno, House, Trance and Goa styles together. Jajuk comes with preselected ambiences out of the box but you can create new ones or add/remove styles from them.</p>
<h2>
Types of DJs</h2>
<p>
Three kinds of DJs are currently available: transition, proportion or ambience-based DJs. All DJs have commons attributes.</p>
<h3>
Common attributes</h3>
<ul>
<li>
DJ name</li>
<li>
Rating level (from 1 to 4 stars): specify quality we expect from played tracks (using integrated rating system). 1 means no filter, 4 means only best ones.</li>
<li>
Cross-fade duration (seconds) between two tracks.</li>
<li>
Unicity: can a track be played several times in a party ?</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Transitions-based DJ</h3>
<p>
A transition-based DJ generated the playlist using transition rules. For instance, ask the DJ to play two [Rock or Acoustic] genre tracks, then to play three [Jazz or Acid] tracks...</p>
<h3>
Proportions-based DJ</h3>
<p>
Using a proportion-based DJ, you can specify how many tracks set of styles you want to listen. For example, you can select 30% of [Rock or Acoustic] and 40% of [Blues or Folk]. If total is bellow 100%, the DJ will fill the playlist with shuffle tracks from your collection.</p>
<h3>
Ambience-based DJ</h3>
<p>
This DJ is very basic, indeed: it simply plays shuffle tracks of a given ambience.</p>
<h2>
How to use DJs ?</h2>
<p>
The entry point for DJ feature is the DJ button located in the Command view.<a href="../images/3/3b/Dj01.jpg" title="Image:dj01.jpg" class="internal">

Select the "Any" ambience to remove any filter.</p>
<h2>
Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Tag correctly your tracks with genre attribute if you want to make this feature fully useful. For example, you can use CDDB retag function to assist yourself. See [editing.html Editing tags and attributes].</li>
<li>
Don't use set Rating level to a value too high if your collection is young, otherwise, you will get very few tracks in you playlist.</li>
<li>
For proportion DJs: don't set proportion with ambiences mapping too few tracks or you will get very few tracks as well.</li>
