<h1>


















The Physical Files Tree view</h1>


















<p>


















This view can be found in the Physical perspective. It allows you selecting or browsing your devices upon a physical point of view. In this view, you will find:</p>


















<ul>


















<li>


















Devices as you created them in the Device view. Devices contain directories.</li>


















<li>


















Directories</li>


















<li>


















Audio files that Jajuk supports</li>


















<li>


















Playlist files</li>


















</ul>


















<p>


















Notes</p>


















<ul>


















<li>


















Cover files are not visible in the tree.</li>


















<li>


















Tree configuration (nodes expands/collapses) is saved for next Jajuk session.</li>


















</ul>


















<p>


















You can select any item in the tree, all contextual menu action will be applied recursively. For example, if you selected both your "ROCK" main directory and your "POP" main directory, then you right click and select "Play shuffle", Jajuk will play randomly all your ROCK and POP tracks.</p>


















<h2>


















Dragging and dropping items</h2>


















<p>


















At any time, you can drag a selection and drop it over the playlist you want to add selection to (in [../html/view_playlist_repository.html Playlist Repository view]) or over the Playlist Editor View of current Playlist. If current playlist is the queue Playlist (default), a drag on the selection and drop over the [../html/view_playlist_editor.html Playlist Editor View] will result into an immediate play of your selection. Play or Push default behavior during a drag and drop can be set in the [../html/view_parameter.html Parameter view] / Mode tab.</p>
