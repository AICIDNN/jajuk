## This is Jajuk main starting script 

###########################
### CONFIGURATION START ###

#to use your default java on your system use JAVA_BIN="java", or you can give the full path of java.
JAVA_BIN="java"

#JVM arguments used by Jajuk. It's important  to notice that some of this tuning is useful only when using Java player (when mplayer is not available)
# * -client : Use the client JVM, optimized for single user usage [Don't change this setting]
# * -Xms35M : Initial Heap (total JVM reserved memory) size. We set it to a pretty large value because it requires ressources to expand heap size and it causes a blanck when using java player. [it can be reduced to 25M by some users if required]
# * -Xmx512M: Maximal Heap size. We set a large size because Out Of Memory errors make the app crash. In some rare cases, very large collection (>200Gb) users could increase this setting (see Performnce page in the manual). We don't set it to a lower value to avoid Out of Memory issues when performing memory consumming tasks (like generating thumbs). We don't set an higher value because some operations (still generating thumbs) could quicky reach any value and setting this value force the JVM to clear the memory when near to this value (Garbage collecting) [Change this setting only if you have very large collection, do not reduce it]
# * -XX:MinHeapFreeRatio=20 -XX:MaxHeapFreeRatio=30 -Xincgc -XX:NewRatio=12 : fine running parameters that optimizes JVM to garbage collecting as rarely as possible (because a gc 'end of the world' causes an audio blanck). These values have been found by the experience and are pretty difficult to explain (check JVM tunning tutorials if you want to learn more, GC tunning is a almost a science  by itself  ;-)  ), I myself don't remeber exactly their meaning [I think we should keep these parameters as it]
JAVA_OPTIONS="-client -Xms35M -Xmx512M -XX:MinHeapFreeRatio=20 -XX:MaxHeapFreeRatio=30 -Xincgc -XX:NewRatio=12"
