This is the full Jajuk SVN repository 

To compile Jajuk :
(Ant is required, download it on http://ant.apache.org/ )           
$ cd src/scripts
$ ant
(jajuk.jar is built in /tmp/jajuk-dist/jajuk/bin directory by default)

Notes:
* FYI, src/script/build.xml is the full Jajuk packager ant script used to generate every Jajuk package
* All legals information are in src/legals directory
