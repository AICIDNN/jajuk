release notes</span>:<span style="font-style: italic;"></span></p>






<ul>






  <li>
    
    <p>Jajuk 1.3 should work without problem using Java 6</p>

  </li>

  <li>
    
    <p>Upgrading to 1.3 can force a deep refresh for available devices
(takes a while). It is strongly adviced to perform deep refresh of
others devices manually (in Physical tree view / right click / Force
Refresh / Deep).</p>

  </li>

  <li>
    
    <p>When using Catalog view for the first time, all thumbnails
are
created (this can take a while) and it can lead to sound short pauses
only during this process.</p>

  </li>

  <li>
    
    <p>Jajuk 1.2 Java Web Start Users (only): your collection may be
voided. In this case, rename directory &lt;home*&gt;/&lt;your
username&gt;/.jajuk_test to .jajuk (note the dot). (*) Home
is&nbsp;c:\Documents and settings\ under windows and /home under
Linux/Unix/Mac OSX.</p>

  </li>

  <li>
    
    <p>When upgrading from 1.2, date-format custom properties should be
lost. In the future, they will be saved correctly. In case of important
issue, please contact us.</p>

  </li>

  <li>
    
    <p>Reporting an issue using embedded quality agent
(Help-&gt;
report an issue) doesn't work with Thunderbird under windows. Use <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=91412&amp;atid=597086">this
link</a> instead.</p>
